FaceNav is an early-stage program that enables people with severe physical impairments to control their computer with their face.

## The Plan
The plan for FaceNav is two-fold: create an accessible way for people to use macOS and be a platform that can be easily integrated into other programs. 

### Main features to come:

- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Right-click functionality
- A GUI allowing users to easily adjust the sensitivity of facial expressions and cursor speed
