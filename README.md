## Description

For individuals with upper-body impairments, conventional computer input systems can be fatiguing or outright unusable. FaceNav was created to address this issue specifically for macOS. By utilizing **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, FaceNav translates facial expressions into mouse inputs. 

Its current functionality includes mouse movement (up, down, left, and right), left-click, right-click, and drag and drop. It also has a menu bar icon to pause the program.


#### Technologies

- Python and PyObjC
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV

## How To Use FaceNav

Once youâ€™ve installed and launched FaceNav (python main.py), your webcam will activate and begin analyzing your facial expressions in real-time.

Basic Usage:
- Move your mouth **left/right** to move the mouse in the corresponding direction. For **upward movement**, push your bottom lip into your top lip, and for **downward movement**, suck your top lip into your mouth.
- To **left-click**, move your eyebrows up and then back down (dragging can be done by keeping them up).
- To **right-click**, wink with your left eye for about 1 second.

> Tip: try not to move your head much during usage, and use good lighting.
