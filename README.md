FaceNav is an early-stage program that enables people with severe physical impairments to control their computer with their face.

## The Plan
The plan for FaceNav is two-fold: create an accessible way for people to use macOS and be a platform that can easily integrate into other assistive programs. 

### Main features to come:

- A GUI allowing users to easily adjust the sensitivity of facial expressions and cursor speed
- Automatic facial expression sensitivity calibration
